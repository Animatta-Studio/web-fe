    The most important thing when studying in Korea is to clarify the purpose
    of your goal. They should be clear, concise and solid. That means
    understanding what Korean schools specialize in and being honest with
    yourself about how it suits you. Go to the school that best suits your
    aspirations. This greatly influences costs, school types, admission
    requirements, and other relevant living circumstances. <br/>
    <h2 className='text-[20px] mt-2 font-bold underline'>Basics about Korea</h2>

    South Korea is spoken by Kugo, the main language spoken in both North
    and South Korea, and by ethnic Koreans living in northeastern China. They
    call their alphabet "Hangul" and it is one of the most logical and scientific
    alphabets ever devised, dating back to the 15th century. There are 10 vowels
    and 14 consonants, for a total of 24 letters. However, it is a figurative
    language meaning that both vowels and consonants form multiple syllable
    groups. It sounds complicated, but it's actually pretty easy to learn. By
    mastering the alphabet, you will be able to understand Korean even if you
    don't know the words.<br/>

    <h2 className='text-[20px] mt-2 font-bold'>How to Learn Korean</h2>

    There are many options for learning Korean. You can study at home or in
    parallel with your studies. However, it is better to know before going so as
    not to get lost. This will affect how long you want to stay in Korea and what
    you want to study.<br/>
    For example, if you are only studying for one or two semesters, you can go
    to Korean Language Institute (KLI). However, if you plan to study in South
    Korea, you will need to find a university that will fund your student visa.
    Mirai International Education provides full support for students in searching
    for schools and colleges in Korea, completing visa process paperwork, and
    more.

    <h2 className='text-[20px] mt-2 font-bold'>WHY SINGAPORE</h2>

    Everyone has their own reasons for choosing a particular country to explore
    career opportunities, and they need their own reasons, but as far as the global
    economic scenario is concerned, Singapore is one of the fastest growing
    economies on the Asia continent. For this reason, thousands of young people
    apply for study visas and jobs in the country each year. Some of the main
    reasons for this madness of Singaporean youth are: <br/>

    <h2 className='text-[20px] mt-2 font-bold'>Better standard of living</h2>

    Singapore is one of the closest Asian countries to provide quality living. For this
    reason, thousands of young people seek Singapore student visas every year. It is
    one of the few countries in Asia that offers all the conveniences and technology
    that only European and American countries have.<br/>

    <h2 className='text-[20px] mt-2 font-bold'>Huge opportunities of the job market</h2>

    We all know that the Asian economy has been on an upward trend for the past
    decade. The same scenario will continue for the next 20-30 years, according to
    large speculators. other Southeast Asian countries. For this reason, people prefer
    Singapore to any other country when looking for better study and work
    opportunities.<br/>
  
    <h2 className='text-[20px] mt-2 font-bold'>Low tax rates</h2>
  
    Another important reason many talented young people seek study and work
    support in Singapore is the country's low tax rate compared to other similarly
    developed economies in the world.

<span className='font-bold text-[22px]'>APPLY FOR A JAPANESE STUDENT VISA</span><br/>
<ul className='list-disc'>
<li>Prospective applicants must be at least 18 years of age or more and have graduated from
high school or above.</li>
<li>Aspirants from these countries’ high school graduates as their final educational background,
can not apply for a student visa or higher education in Japan.</li>
<li>Besides the above, there are a few other requirements which applicants need to comply with
and submit to the school for consideration of their application for a student visa. Following
is the list of documents:<br/>
<ul className='list-inside list-decimal'>
<li>Passport copy.</li>
<li>2 pics photos (4X 3cm).</li>
<li>Highest education certificate.</li>

<li>JLPT/NAT/Japanese language certificate.</li>
<li>Sponsor documents.</li>
<li>Bank balance certificate.</li>
<li>Employment certificate.</li>
<li>Tax certificate/Pay slips.</li>
</li><br/>
<span className='font-bold text-[22px]'>GET A COE</span><br/>
To obtain a student visa, you must first obtain a COE in Japan. The language school of your
choice will apply for the COE on your behalf to the Japanese Immigration Bureau. The
above documents are the same as the documents that must be submitted to the Immigration
Bureau. COE result dates are not fixed and are subject to change. If your and your sponsor's
documentation is good, your girlfriend's COE is more likely to be approved. Therefore, it is
advantageous to have a school agent. We can review your documents to ensure they are
clear, easy to understand, and likely to be approved.<br/>
<span className='font-bold text-[22px]'>GETTING YOUR STUDENT VISA</span><br/>
Once your COE results have been issued (usually 5-6 weeks before the course start), the
school will send you a copy of your COE, an invoice for tuition and other fees (if requested
in your acceptance letter) will be Payment must be made by the due date to receive the
original COE in the mail.<br/>
Once you have received your original COE, you will need to apply for a student visa at the
nearest Japanese Embassy in your country. To apply for a student visa, you must submit the<br/>
<ul className='list-inside list-disc'>
<li>original COE</li>
<li>approval decision</li>
<li>valid passport</li>
<li>The passport photo was taken within the last 6 months</li></ul>
Applying for a student visa depends on where you apply, the visa process may take him 3-
7 days, but we recommend that he apply at least two weeks in advance of his travel plans.
If your COE is rejected, the immigration office will usually provide a brief reason why your
application was rejected. If you wish to apply again, please contact us first. If you apply
again, you cannot reuse the documents you have already submitted. You will need to submit
new copies of your sponsor's documents and a new signed application. Your preferred
school (the school that processed your application) may not accept re-applications. So if you
have a history of COE rejections, expect fewer school options.<br/><br/>
